- title: The Art of Conceptual Engineering
  text: >
    I've already got a solution for you. It's a convergence of contemporary art and engineering. Something that can be useful for all kind of areas from education to retail, from finances to museums. Even if you can't localize a problem from your practical field, if you’ve tried conventional methods, but there is still no development then try what I’ve got. Look at my method containers, check the realized (implemented) projects to feel my way of thinking and to select a method that will be useful for your practice. Be decisive to try obscurity for the first time.
