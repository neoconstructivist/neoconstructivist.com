:description: Coffee and Museum in one cup placed on a surface of urban life
:introduction: The idea to realize a project of an experimental café in Minsk has
  emerged at the moment of working on the National pavilion at the Venice Biennale.
  The idea was to invent a space with the conception of a café at the museum, so that
  there would be the feeling of a museum and a café at one and the same time. To create
  the prototype of a conceptual museum.

:text: "The idea to realize a project of an experimental café in Minsk has emerged
  at the moment of working on the National pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The idea
  was to invent a space with the conception of a café at the museum, so that there
  would be the feeling of a museum and a café at one and the same time. To create
  the prototype of a conceptual museum. \n\nAnother essential objective was to construct
  an urban space with the type of audience not typical for a cultural project, the
  audience, that was forming due to the randomness of urban traffic and need to drop
  in for 10 minutes, take some rest and drink a cup of coffee. I would like to update
  perpetually the interior of the café, experiment with expositions but all the processes
  should be payed off with coffee sale. The project succeeded and 2 years of its functioning
  revealed its new aspects I hadn’t thought of when projecting it.\n\nWhat kind of
  future I see for the Kafe Kultura. In this small café, that can be a future form
  of a 'conceptual museum' with its changing exhibitions of images and artifacts,
  I hope to extend the dialogue between citizens, visitors of cafe, between image
  and memory, between present and past. Currently I’m exploring the potential of building
  a physical copy of the café for transfer and installation at various possible sites
  within the EU. The idea being to present through video cameras, and Mobile App a
  real time mirror of life as it is simultaneously experienced in the network of cafes,
  one in Minsk, the others in a new temporary location.\n\nFor some expositions we
  made short videos to promote the Idea, so you can take a look:\n\n1. Time for Culture
