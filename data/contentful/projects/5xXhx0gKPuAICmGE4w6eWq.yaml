  This installation became another alternation of the Café’s contextual environment.
  The problems built around the conflict between a letter as a symbol from the alphabet
  and a letter as a graphical representation of a sound with the help of a font.\n\nThe
  visitors could play with letters, create non-existent words from them. They could
  take letters from known words and compose new ones, the ones that they could only
  dream of. There were several font objects in the café. \n\nA calligraphic font by
  Constantine Selikhanov from Logoses / Wall series. His work translates a saying
  into a physical sculpture, located along two sides of a wall. Neon inscriptions
  “Know the price” and “You can be free” represent two poles, and an observer’s objective
  is to build a connection between them. In this project the author makes references
  to the Bruce Nauman neon art.\n\nThe workshop of Pavel Semchenko exhibited 3 letters
  manufactured for “Ploshchad Lenina” sign in the Minsk subway system. \n\nA poster
  by Yuri  Toreev for play “Chichikov” of the Kupala Theatre based on “Dead Souls”
  by Gogol represented a letter as a part of a drawing , mile stone “Ч”.\n\nThe café
  also exhibited several font versions of letter “A” developed for signs in Germany
  and Portugal, a contribution from the private collection of Taras Kalyagin.  US
  license plates represented the most versatile method of combination of different
  fonts in a limited space.  \n\nThe project’s idea belongs to Denis Serebryakov.
  \nThe project was implemented by Alexei Shinkarenko. \nThe café exhibited the works
  by Pavel Semchenko, Yuri Toreev, Constantine Selikhanov, as well as items from the
  collection of Taras Kalyagin."
