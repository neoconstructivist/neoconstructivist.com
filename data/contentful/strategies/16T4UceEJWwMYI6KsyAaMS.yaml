:text: 'The modern interpretation of avant-garde method invented in Soviet Russia.
  Its essence was in creating objective, true stories made up of a set of documentary
  facts, a set of truths and real phenomena. Daily life in factography is interpreted
  as a series of facts creating nonlinear structures of time. The elements of factography
  comprise objects inspiring people’s absolute confidence. One of them is photography
  being decoded as one’s own view, as the means of documentation of one’s own view.
  It involves in the interpretation process visual images from one’s own memory as
  if we look at them now reviving an image in such a way. '
