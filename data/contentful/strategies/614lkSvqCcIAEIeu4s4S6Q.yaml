:title: Non-material Restoration
:description: Memory visualisation as a type of Non-material Restoration of the Museum
  objects
:text: Any object from material things can be studied as a physical object as well
  as an imaginary, non-material object. Museum restoration usually presupposes the
  restoration of physical characteristics, the material state of an object. Our method
  can be applied to its imaginary, valuable, non-material properties that get lost
  or become obsolete over time. The method is based on a presupposition concerning
  the increasing role of a myth of an object as well as the information field formed
  around it with a simultaneous weakening of manâ€™s ability to feel the object materially.
